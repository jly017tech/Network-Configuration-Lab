  In my IT homelab, I performed a network discovery scan using Nmap Zenmap GUI to identify active hosts within the subnet 10.11.2.0/24. I configured a Quick Scan profile using the -T4 and -F flags to optimize speed and efficiency, successfully detecting devices including the ITADMIN host and other systems on the network. After completing the scan, I saved the results as local-quick.xml in the home directory for future analysis and documentation. This project helped me gain hands-on experience with network scanning, XML reporting, and interpreting scan results, improving my practical skills in network security and reconnaissance techniques.
